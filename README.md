## Description

The Floyd Warshall algorithm is a graph algorithm used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It can handle both positive and negative edge weights, but it doesn't work for graphs with negative cycles.

This project provides the recursion implementations of the algorithm:
(The imperative version is also included for comparison through unittest)
